A simple application to test out using node js server that utilises the fastify NPM package and implements a Swagger interface for documentation.

The application is a simple Garage application where you can add cars to the garage, fetch cars and also delete them

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites


To be installed before running
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) - Node package manager
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The runtime environment
* [MongoDB]() - The database for storing data

### Installing
